## Scenario Description:
As universities grow and student populations increase, the management of on-campus and off-campus student housing becomes more complex. Our project focuses on developing a Student Housing Management System that streamlines the operations of student accommodations.

This system is designed to help housing administrators, students, and building managers efficiently manage various aspects of student housing, including rent payments, lease agreements, maintenance requests, and utilities. The database will provide a centralized platform to track apartment availability, assign roommates, process rent payments, and handle maintenance requests. It will also support additional functionalities such as parking permit management, furniture inventory, and staff assignments.

From a managerial perspective, this system will allow university housing officials to gain valuable insights into occupancy rates, maintenance costs, and rent collection trends, while students will benefit from a seamless process for managing their housing experience. The queries we generate will offer data-driven insights for housing administrators to make informed decisions on budget allocation, facility maintenance, and room assignments.

Our solution will cater to university housing departments, student landlords, and off-campus property managers who wish to manage their student properties efficiently and provide an optimal living environment for students.
