## Scenario Description:
As universities grow and student populations increase, the management of off-campus student housing becomes more complex. Our project focuses on developing a Student Housing Management System that streamlines the operations of student accommodations.

This system is designed to help housing administrators, students, and building managers efficiently manage various aspects of student housing, including rent payments, lease agreements, maintenance requests, utilities, and more. The database will provide a centralized platform to track apartment availability, process rent payments, and handle maintenance requests. It will also support additional functionalities such as parking permit management, and furniture inventory.

From a managerial perspective, this system will allow housing officials to gain valuable insights into occupancy rates, maintenance costs, and rent collection trends, while students will benefit from a more efficient process for managing their housing experience. The queries will offer data-driven insights for them to make informed decisions on areas such as budget allocation, facility maintenance, and room assignments.

Our solution will cater to university housing departments, student landlords, and off-campus property managers who wish to manage their student properties efficiently and provide an optimal living environment for students.

## Data Model:
![Model project 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/14c07fe7-a483-45ea-bc96-11df706f58ea)


Our model is based on the structure of a hypothetical housing corporation.

## Data Dictionary:

## Queries: 
1. Query 1 lists all of the pending maintenance requests.

2. Query 2 lists the student name, building name, and apartment number of all residents with an overdue rent payment.

3. Query 3 lists the names and total rent cost for a year long lease for each resident.

4. Query 4 lists the room number, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, monthly rent, and the name of the building for all apartments still available for rent.

5. Query 5 lists the furniture inventory for each apartment by showing the apartment ID, the type of furniture, the quantity of each type, and the condition of the furniture. The results are ordered by the apartment ID and the type of furniture.
